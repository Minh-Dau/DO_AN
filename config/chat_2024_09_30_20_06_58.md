1. **You**: Click the register button on the new home page to open the registration page 
2. **ChatGPT**: If you want to implement a feature that allows a user to click a "Register" button on a homepage and open a registration page, here’s a simple way to do that using HTML and JavaScript.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create the Homepage with a Register Button:**
   You need to create an HTML file for the home page that includes a "Register" button.

   ```html
   <!-- home.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Home Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Welcome to the Home Page!</h1>
       <button id="registerButton">Register</button>

       <script>
           // Step 2: Add an event listener to the button
           document.getElementById('registerButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
               // Step 3: Redirect to the registration page
               window.location.href = 'registration.html';
           });
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. **Create the Registration Page:**
   Next, create a simple HTML file for the registration page where users can fill out their information.

   ```html
   <!-- registration.html -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <title>Registration Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Registration Form</h1>
       <form>
           <label for="username">Username:</label>
           <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required><br><br>

           <label for="email">Email:</label>
           <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required><br><br>

           <label for="password">Password:</label>
           <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required><br><br>

           <input type="submit" value="Register">
       </form>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

### Key Points Explained

- **HTML Structure**: The homepage (`home.html`) has a button that triggers the action to navigate to the registration page. The registration page (`registration.html`) contains a form for user inputs.

- **Event Listener**: An event listener is added to the button using `addEventListener`. This makes the button clickable, and when clicked, it will execute the function inside it.

- **Redirecting Pages**: The `window.location.href` property is used to change the current page to the registration page. This is a simple way to navigate between pages in a web application.

### Final Notes
- Make sure both HTML files are saved in the same directory so that the navigation works correctly.
- You can expand the registration form with additional fields or styles to make it more user-friendly.

3. **You**: Click the register button on the new home page to open the registration page    # Home routes
  get 'home/new', to: 'home#new', as: 'new_home'
  post 'home', to: 'home#create', as: 'create_home'  # Đoạn này là hành động tạo mới

  # Registration routes
  get 'dangky', to: 'dangky#new'  # Trang about
4. **ChatGPT**: It seems like you're working with routes in a Ruby on Rails application, specifically for a home page and a registration page. Let's break down what you have and explain how to implement the functionality you described.

### Understanding the Routes

1. **Home Routes:**
   - `get 'home/new', to: 'home#new', as: 'new_home'`
     - This route defines a GET request to 'home/new', which will trigger the `new` action in the `HomeController`. You can access this route using the path helper `new_home_path`.
   - `post 'home', to: 'home#create', as: 'create_home'`
     - This route defines a POST request to 'home', which will trigger the `create` action in the `HomeController`. You can access this route using the path helper `create_home_path`.

2. **Registration Routes:**
   - `get 'dangky', to: 'dangky#new'`
     - This route defines a GET request to 'dangky', which will trigger the `new` action in the `DangkyController`. This is typically the action used to display the registration form.

### Implementing the Registration Button

To implement a "Register" button on your home page that links to the registration page, follow these steps:

1. **Create the Button in the View:**
   In your home page view file (e.g., `app/views/home/new.html.erb`), add a button or link that routes to the registration page:

   ```erb
   <%= link_to 'Register', dangky_path, class: 'btn btn-primary' %>
   ```

   - Here, `link_to` creates a hyperlink. The first argument is the text that will be displayed (e.g., "Register").
   - The second argument is the path to which the link directs you, which is provided by the `dangky_path` method.
   - The `class` attribute is optional and can be customized based on your CSS framework.

2. **Create the Registration Form:**
   In your `DangkyController`, you should have a `new` action that prepares the form for user registration. In the corresponding view file (e.g., `app/views/dangky/new.html.erb`), you will create a form:

   ```erb
   <h1>Register</h1>

   <%= form_with model: @user, url: create_home_path do |form| %>
     <div class="field">
       <%= form.label :username %>
       <%= form.text_field :username %>
     </div>
     <div class="field">
       <%= form.label :email %>
       <%= form.email_field :email %>
     </div>
     <div class="field">
       <%= form.label :password %>
       <%= form.password_field :password %>
     </div>

     <div class="actions">
       <%= form.submit "Create Account" %>
     </div>
   <% end %>
   ```

3. **Controller Logic:**
   In your `DangkyController`, ensure you have the necessary actions to handle the registration:

   ```ruby
   class DangkyController < ApplicationController
     def new
       @user = User.new # Assuming you have a User model
     end

     def create
       @user = User.new(user_params)
       if @user.save
         redirect_to root_path, notice: 'Registration successful!'
       else
         render :new
       end
     end

     private

     def user_params
       params.require(:user).permit(:username, :email, :password)
     end
   end
   ```

### Summary of Steps:
- **Define Routes**: Make sure your routes are correctly set up in `config/routes.rb`.
- **Create the Button**: Use `link_to` in the home page view to link to the registration page.
- **Implement Registration Form**: Create a form in the registration view that submits user data.
- **Handle Form Submission**: Implement the create action in the `DangkyController` to process the registration.

By following these steps, you will create a smooth transition from the home page to a registration page in your Ruby on Rails application. Let me know if you need any more help!
